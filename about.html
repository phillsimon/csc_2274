        <h1>About Phillip Simon</h1>
        <p>Phillip has always been a photographer. He fulfilled his childhood fantasy of using fancy cameras when he got his first
        35 mm film camera at the age of 13. As a printmaking major at the University of the Arts, Phill learned and practiced
        the art of graphic arts, combining drawing and photography with traditional printmaking techniques. In 1980, during
        graduate school at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, he began experimenting with multi-image techniques to
        marry image and sound to express ideas.</p>
        <p>Phillip Simon works as an interactive media producer, program designer, and content strategist. He teaches at Quinnipiac
        University in Hamden, Connecticut, in the Interactive Media Master’s Program in the School of Communications and served
        as its director from 2009 until 2022.</p>
