<h1>Phillip Simon</h1>


<p class="bold text-bright">At the age of 13, visual storytelling became a part of my DNA with my first 35mm camera. I owned Nikon and Leica film cameras and loved them all. In college, I merged my photography and drawing skills into traditional printmaking. During my master’s program in the 1980s, I began experimenting with multimedia techniques – marrying image and sound to express ideas.</p>

<p>Shortly after, I collaborated with dance and theater companies to create sound designs for their performances. This led me to produce videos. In 1987 the Yale School of Medicine hired me to establish their internal video production unit.</p>
